>So here it's .. and it's called chalk .. which I love for it's sound and colors.

Language is still in designing phase ... that means the way you write in some code may change in the feautre 

Features :-
```
	Not really much because as I said it's still under heavy development but to count a few
	- Lua like syntax (I like lua and it's syntax, and there's no reason to hate it =D)
	- Automatic type detection 
	- Automatic memory managemnt (For bytecode only!)
	- Basic I/O & Math library built-in
	- Quite easy VM so you can implement it in any programming language you like on any platform
	- Fast .. if follows a linear approach for the compiler and the VM .. making it bleeding edge
```
